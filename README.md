# ⚔️ AlgoWars
Graph-based strategy game driven by divide-and-conquer and smart pathfinding algorithms.


> A war strategy game powered by graph algorithms, AI techniques, and smart pathfinding — built with Python (or Go).

---

## 🎯 Concept

**Algo Wars** is a battle simulation game where countries are represented as nodes in a graph. Players must use algorithmic thinking to launch missile attacks, choose optimal paths, and manage limited resources. The gameplay is driven by classic and advanced algorithms including:

- 🔁 Divide and Conquer
- 📍 Dijkstra’s & A* Pathfinding
- 🧠 Basic AI decision-making
- 🗺️ Graph traversal and cost optimization

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 📌 **Graph-based world map**: each node is a country, each edge is a potential missile route.
- 🚀 **Multiple missile types**: each with different range, cost, and damage.
- 🧠 **Algorithmic strategy engine**: simulate and evaluate different attack plans.
- 🎮 **Turn-based gameplay** with dynamic threat assessment.
- 🎓 Designed as a course project for *Algorithm Design* class — but built with real-world logic.
